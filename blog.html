    <h2>Is it a crime?</h2>
    <h5>April 26, 2018</h5>
    </br>
    <p>This may come, This may come as some surprise….,but I miss you. It’s only been 3 months, but I find myself dreaming of you. I miss the way you smell, the way you feel, the way you sound. Nothing would bring me more joy than to taste you one last time. Here in this sweltering city of feijao and file de peixe, I need you. I thought I knew what I wanted. I thought this was what I wanted. I see now that I was wrong.</p>
    <p>How have you been? I heard that you were a little under the weather and had to close shop. Sorry to hear about that. Honestly, I can’t bear the thought of someone else having you. Does that make me a terrible person? I know now why you might want to be with someone else. Especially after the way I acted. I had time to reflect on our many times together. I regret always giving you a hard time. My impatience, abrasiveness, lack of understanding. Always asking for extra guacamole. Demanding my sour cream and hot sauce on the side. Rolling my eyes when you would only give me a few cornels of your sweet, sweet corn. Oh how I miss the reward of having your hot, flavorful grilled veggies. I would always get angry because I thought sometimes you were taking too long. I now understand that good things come to those who are willing to experience the prolonged agony that is those extra 3 minutes.</p><p>No one does it like you. I’ve tried to replace you, searching the streets for anything that might resemble you. I even tried to recreate you, using various ingredients. Thinking, maybe if I close my eyes and imagine that it’s you I’ll be able to experience the ecstasy I felt after devouring you. I was terribly wrong. I know you miss me. Miss my walking in 3 minutes before closing and demanding you give me what I need. Miss my asking that you make fresh guacamole when you say you’re all out. Miss my flirting with Potbelly and the falafel place when you weren’t around.</p><p>I won’t keep you any longer. It’s just…we ended so abruptly. I was hoping when I return we could reconcile. Maybe you could meet me in the airport. I doubt you’d come to Brazil. It’s crazy of me to think you would after the way I left you. If you did, you would make me so happy. Anyway, I love you! I’ll see you soon.</p></br>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Your Love and Your Light</p></h3>
